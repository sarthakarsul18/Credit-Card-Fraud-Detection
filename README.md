"Credit Card Fraud Detection" 
"This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using Logistic Regression. The dataset, creditcard.csv, is preprocessed by dropping the 'Time' column and standardizing the features with StandardScaler. Initial model training and evaluation on the original dataset show the performance through classification reports and confusion matrices. To address the issue of class imbalance, the dataset is resampled using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which generates synthetic samples for the minority class. After resampling, the Logistic Regression model is retrained and achieves an impressive 98% accuracy. This improved model performance highlights the effectiveness of handling imbalanced data in fraud detection. The final evaluation includes a detailed classification report and confusion matrix, visualized using a heatmap to illustrate the results clearly."
